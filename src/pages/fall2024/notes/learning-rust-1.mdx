# Learning Rust 1

## Introductions

- introductions of two students

## Learning Rust

We are using [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
and [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings).

### Basics

- Use cargo to initialize a new project (1.3)
- Review the guessing game to see functions, I/O, mutable variables
- Review section 3.1 for mutability and shadowing
- Review section 3.2 for data types
- Review section 3.3 for functions, parameters, and returning values
- Review section 3.5 for `if`, `loop`, loop labels, `while`, `for`

Complete exercises for sections 0-3, plus the first quiz.

### Ownership

- understand ownership

> Each value in Rust has an owner.

> There can only be one owner at a time.

> When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

- variables and scope, stack vs heap

```rust
let x = 5;
let y = x;
```

- this works because both variables are on the stack

```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1;
```

- `s1` is no longer in scope!

```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1.clone();
```

- due to the `clone()`, `s1` is still in scope

- functions and scope

  - see listings under Ownership and Functions in 4.1

- review references and mutable references

> At any given time, you can have either one mutable reference or any number of
> immutable references.

> References must always be valid.

- complete exercises for section 4, on primitive types. Complete exercises for
  section 6, on move semantics.

### Structs

- review structs from section 5

- complete exerises for section 7, on structs.
