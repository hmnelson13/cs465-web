## TLS handshake and DH key exchange

- the main purpose of the TLS handshake is to etablish a shared key
- note this shows Diffie-Hellman, but there are a variety of ways to complete
  the handshake

![TLS handshake and key exchange](/images/notes/tls-handshake-dh.png)

- parts of the handshake

  - Client Hello
    - Random client: random number used later to derive shared key
    - Cipher Suites: zero or more
    - Session ID: can be used to update or resume a connection
  - Server Hello
    - Random server: random number used later to dervice shared key
    - Cipher Suite: the single cipher suite selected from the client's list (or
      the connection is closed if none is available)
    - Session ID: can indicate a resumed connection or a new connection
  - Server Certificate
    - a chain of certificates that authenticate the server to the client
  - Server Key Exchange
    - random client from above
    - random server from above
    - signed Diffie-Hellman parameters
  - Server Hello Done
    - empty, signals end of key exchange messages
    - note, this is needed because, e.g. Server Key Exchange message may not be
      needed
  - Client Key Exchange
    - public Diffie Hellman message
  - Change Cipher Spec
    - potentially multiple messages to change the cipher suite
  - Finished

    - sent after cipher change messages
    - verifies the key exchange and authentication was successful
    - contains some data to verify the previous exchanges -- HMAC of master
      secret, a text string, hash of hasndshake messages
    - first message protected with the negotiated algorithms, keys, and secrets
    - after this message, the peers can exchange data

  - everything after the key exchange is encrypted and protected with a MAC
    (unless AES GCM mode used) -- this means an attacker cannot modify
    algorithms chosen
  - can use a _pre-shared key_, meaning a key from a previous session
  - Diffie-Hellman keys are ephemeral -- erased after use

## TLS Cipher Suites

- defines the algorithms used during the TLS connection

  - key exchange algorithm -- for exchanging/creating a symmetric encryption key
  - authentication algorithm -- for digital signatures
  - bulk encryption algorithm -- for encrypting the data
  - MAC algorithm -- for security

- example: _ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256_

  - ECDHE:
    [Elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_Diffieâ€“Hellman)
  - ECDSA -- Elliptic-curve Digital Signature Algorithm
  - AES 128 -- AES with 128-bit key
  - GCM -- Galois/Counter Mode -- block cipher with high performance
    (parallelizable) and patent-free
  - SHA256 -- MAC algorithm
