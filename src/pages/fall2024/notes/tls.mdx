### Obtaining a certificate for a website

- It used to be expensive to get a certificate for a website
  - You can now get one free with Let's Encrypt
  - It uses a protocol called ACME to automatically verify you own a domain
  - For example, you contact an ACME server to request a certificate, and it
    gives you a file to serve from your website, once it verifies that you are
    serving it, then it issues you the certificate
