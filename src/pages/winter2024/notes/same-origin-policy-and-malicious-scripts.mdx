# Same origin policy and malicious scripts

## Key concepts

# Same origin policy

- goal #1: prevent JavaScript from one site interfering with a web page from
  another site
  - without this, a malicious site could load JavaScript to read your credit
    card details on another site that you have loaded
- goal #2: allow friendly domains to share scripts (e.g. two divisions of the
  same company), allow ads from third parties
- reminder -- sharing scripts is possible with the `<script>` tag and the `src`
  attribute
