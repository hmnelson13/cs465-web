# Intrusion detection and scanners

## Intrusion detection

- try to identify unauthorized or malicious traffic
- intrusion detection system

  - monitors events
  - logs related data
  - analyzes data
  - reports events requiring human attention

- may monitor processes, programs, commands, data at rest, network packets
- need to collect evidence for a forensic process
- intrusion prevention system

  - includes active responses
  - alter packets, strip out malware, reset TCP connections, terminate processes
  - real-time

- understand network-based IDS vs host-based IDS, and different types of data
  they collect

- [see Figure 11.1, page312](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch11-rev1.pdf)
  to understand IDS event outcomes and metrics

- understand the example, below the figure, to see why alarm precision is
  helpful
- understand that false positives keeps security experts busy (but wasting time)
  -- frustrating to deal with
- false negatives are of course also harmful

## Approaches to intrusion detection

- [see Table 11.1, page 314](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch11-rev1.pdf)
- signature-based
  - signatures usually automatically updated from vendor
  - may look at behavior (effects of the attack) as well
- specification-based
  - define what is allowed for a protocol or application
- anomaly-based
  - measure normal behavior
  - classify anything else as an anomaly
  - often uses machine learning
  - challenges
    - feature selection
    - intruder-free training
    - session creep (intruders slowly adding themselves)

## Sniffers

- to look at network traffic, need to capture packets and examine them at line
  speed
- helpful even outside of intrusion detection
- also used by attackers!
- understand difference between a hub and a switch, and how this affects traffic
  seen by a host
- network cards can be put into promiscuous mode to sniff traffic

## Vulnerability assessment tools

- explore weaknesses in your systems so that you can modify / update them for
  increased security
- vulnerability assessment -- examines systems for vulnerability
- penetration testing -- tries to exploit a vulnerability
- can be used for both defense and offense
- make sure you get authorization to do any kind of vulnerabilty assessment or
  penetration testing
- make sure you follow responsible disclosure when finding a vulnerability
- port scanning is a common assessment tool -remote OS fingerprint is also a
  common assessment tool
- see example of what `nmap` can do
- see example of what `Nessus` can do

- TBD: research to reduce false alarms, usability
