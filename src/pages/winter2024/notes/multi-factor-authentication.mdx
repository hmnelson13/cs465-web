# Multi-factor authentication

### passwordless FIDO2

- hardware security keys -- see [Yubico](https://www.yubico.com)

  - generate a public/private keypair for each website you use
  - prove ownership of the private key in a challenge

- Passkeys

  - same technology, but keypairs are encrypted and stored in a cloud account, e.g. Apple Keychain
  - similar to a password manager, but for cryptographic keys
  - Apple requires 2FA on your account if you are going to store Passkeys there

  - see [Google](https://safety.google/authentication/passkey/)
  - see [Apple](https://developer.apple.com/passkeys/) and [About the security of passkeys](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102195)
  - see [Microsoft](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/passkeys-in-windows-301c8944-5ea2-452b-9886-97e4d2ef4422)
  - see [1Password](https://1password.com/product/passkeys)

- Both are resistant to phishing, brute force attacks, password breaches
