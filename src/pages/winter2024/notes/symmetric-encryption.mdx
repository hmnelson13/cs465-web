# Symmetric Encryption

## Ungraded Quiz

- What is the cryptographic key in a Caeasar cipher? In a substitution cipher?

## Key Concepts

Be familiar with diagrams like
[Figure 2.1, page 31](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch2-rev1.pdf)

These diagrams use cryptographic notation.

For any given encryption key, you can try to guess it by exhaustively trying all
possible keys -- this is called an _exhaustive key search_ or a \_brute force
search.

- Example: DES keys, 56 bits
- A keyspace of 56 bits provides 2 56 ≈ 7.2×10^16 possible keys. At a rate of
  10^12 keys per second it would take approximately 7.2×10^4 seconds or about 20
  hours to try every key.
- In January 1999, distributed.net and the Electronic Frontier Foundation
  collaborated to publicly break a DES key in 22 hours and 15 minutes.

Attacks:

- A _ciphertext-only_ attack requires the attacker to guess the plaintext (or
  the key) using only the ciphertext.
- A _known-plaintext_ attack means the attacker has access to examples of both
  plaintext and ciphertext.
- A _chosen-plaintext_ attack means the attacker can choose a plaintext and see
  the corresponding encrypted ciphertext.
- A \_chosen-chiphertext\* attack meanst he attacker can choose ciphertext and
  see the corresponding decrypted plaintext.

Adversaries:

- A _passive_ adversary can only observe messages.
- An _active_ adversary can inject or alter messages.

### Symmetric Encryption

Symmetric encryption allows one party to send encrypted data to another party,
provided they have a _shared key_. It is called symmetric encryption because the
same key is used for decryption and encryption.

Caesar cipher with a shift of 23:

Vernam cipher: see

- If using a random stream of bits for the key, and never reuse the same key,
  this is a _one-time pad_.
- A one-time pad is information-theoretically secure for confidentiality: "even
  given unlimited computing power and time, an attacker without the key cannot
  recover plaintext from ciphertext".
- Useful in theory! Try to approach its level of security.
- In practice, we try to have _computational security_, meaning protection
  against an attacker with fixed resources, unable to brute force keys chosen
  from a large space.
- Has no integrity.

### Types of ciphers

- stream cipher -- encrypt one bit or one character at a time
- block cipher -- encrypt chunks of fixed size, e.g. 128 bits, pad smaller
  blocks with a 1 and then zeroes.
  - AES is the most common block cipher --
    [see Figure 2.3, page 34](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch2-rev1.pdf)

### Block cipher modes

Used when encrypting multiple blocks.
