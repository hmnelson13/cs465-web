  Hello! I'm excited to try out new content and a new format for this class this
  semester. My research area is usable security and privacy, which focuses on
  people and designing technology that fits their needs. My hobbies include
  reading, hiking, genealogy, and landscape photography. You can learn more
  about me at [zappala.byu.edu](https://zappala.byu.edu).
