# Encryption

## Objectives

In this project, you will gain experience using cryptographic primitives
including symmetric encryption, public-key encryption, message authentication
codes, and digital signatures. You will use these together to implement a
hybrid-encryption scheme, a scheme that you could find in the real world.

In addition to teaching about cryptography, this lesson also serves to improve
your familiarity with enterprise-development languages and practices. This
includes introducing you to C#, containerized development, and reading through
online document. These are important real-world skills and practicing them in
this class will help give you an advantage when you enter the workforce.

## Requirements

In this project you will be implementing an encrypted echo client and server.

An echo server receives string from clients and simply echos those strings back
to the clients. An echo client reads input from the command line, sends that
input to the echo server, and prints to the command line anything it receives
from the server.

I have provided you a working echo server and client that you will enhance to
secure communication using hybrid encryption. To complete this project, you will
take the following steps:

1. Download and unzip the [handout file](/files/encryption-handout.zip).
2. Open the project using Visual Studio Code. Build and reopen in a dev
   container.
3. Modify the `EncryptedEchoServer.cs` and `EncryptedEchoClient.cs` files to
   support hybrid encryption. Do not add, edit, or delete any other source
   files.

When implementing the required functionality, make sure you use the same block
modes, padding, and hashing algorithms on the client and server, otherwise it
won't work. Use the ones indicated in this writeup and in the source code, or
your submission won't pass the autograder.

### Echo Client

On the client you will implement three methods:

1. `ProcessServerHello`: This method will read a RSA public key sent by the
   server when the client first connects. This key will be encoded using Base64.
2. `TransformOutgoingMessage`: This method will be responsible for applying
   hybrid encryption to the messages typed into the console:
   1. You will need to generate an AES, message encryption key. You will use
      this key to encrypt the message using CBC mode and PKCS7 padding. You
      should use a different key each time you encrypt a message.
   2. You will need to generate an HMAC for your plaintext message. Use the
      SHA256 variant of the HMAC algorithm. Generate a random key each time you
      generate a HMAC.
   3. Encrypt the two keys you generated using RSA. Use the OAEP padding scheme
      with SHA256.
3. `TransformIncomingMessage`: This method will be responsible for processing
   messages sent by the echo server and validating their digital signatures.
   Make sure to use PSS padding with SHA256.

### Echo Server

Your server will need to generate an RSA key upon starting. It will also need to
implement three methods:

1. `GetServerHello`: Returns the server's RSA public key encoded using Base64.
2. `TransformIncomingMessage`: This method will be responsible for applying
   hybrid encryption to the messages typed into the console:
   1. Decrypt the message encryption and HMAC keys using the server's RSA key.
   2. Decrypt the message with AES using CBC mode and PKCS7 padding.
   3. Verify the HMAC of the received message. Use the SHA256 variant of the
      HMAC algorithm.
3. `TransformOutgoingMessage`: This method will be responsible for using the
   server's RSA key to digitally sign messages being sent by the server. Make
   sure to use PSS padding with SHA256.

## Starting Point

The cryptographic primitives needed in this project can all be found in the
`System.Security.Cryptography` namespace. You will need the `AES`, `RSA`,
`HMACSHA256`, and `RandomNubmerGenerator` classes to complete this lab. Read up
on how they work.

By default, the provided run a basic echo server without encryption. I recommend
that you add the functionality step by step:

1. Have the server generate and send a public key in its hello message.
2. Implement hybrid encryption on the client.
3. Implement hybrid decryption on the server.
4. Implement HMAC generation on the client.
5. Implement HMAC verification on the server.
6. Implement signature generation on the server.
7. Implement signature verification on the client.

If you add functionality in this order, you should largely avoid breaking your
solution as you slowly add more features.

To aid in testing, I have provided you with an `echo-test` executable that fully
implements the desired spec. You can use this to test your finished solutions.
If they work with `echo-test` they are likely to work with the pass-off script
used for grading. If you are using an ARM device (like the Mac M1/M2) use
`echo-test-arm`.

## Resources

C# as a language sits between C/C++ and Java. Like Java, it is a high-level
language, that abstracts many details about memory management and types. Like
C/C++ it allows low-level access to hardware. You will only need a basic
understanding of C# to complete this lab. The following are some resources to
get you started about C# and its libraries:

- [A tour of the C# language](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/)
- [System.Security.Cryptography](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.cryptography?view=net-7.0)
  documentation. You can find documentation for any security functionality you
  will need on linked from this page. Some items you may want to look at
  include,
  - RandomNumberGenerator
  - RSA
  - AES
  - HMACSHA256
  - CryptographicException
- [System.Text.Encoding](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.encoding?view=net-7.0)
  for converting between text and bytes.
- [System.Convert](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.convert?view=net-7.0)
  for Base64 encodings.
