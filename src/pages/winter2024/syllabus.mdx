# Syllabus

## Welcome

This course is an experiment this year -- I am broadening the course to provide
a wider introduction to computer security than in the past, including some
topics on privacy, and using only CS 224 as a prerequisite. I am hoping this
course can become accessible to sophomores.

Because this is a revised course, I would like your feedback on how things are
going during the semester. This includes workload, assignment complexity, time
spent on out-of-class activities, etc. Please help me know if I'm meeting my
target. In return, I'll be flexible if anything unexpected happens, assignments
are not clear, or work takes longer than expected.

## Course Description

This course is designed to provide a broad introduction to digital security and
privacy. It helps students think about security as a software engineer and
become ready to take further coursework in security and privacy.

Topics include:

- security concepts and principles,
- cryptographic building blocks,
- authentication,
- operating system security and access control,
- software security,
- malicious software,
- public key certificate management and use,
- web and browser security,
- firewalls and tunnels,
- intrusion detection network-based attacks,
- wireless LAN security,
- privacy, and
- human factors in security.

It concludes with an overview of security and privacy research occurring in the
CS department.

## Learning Outcomes

The learning outcomes for this class include:

- Students will be able to think like an attacker, identifying key assets and
  risks associated with the security of a system
- Students will be able to describe common cybersecurity vulnerabilities and
  issues
- Students will be able to identify common cybersecurity technologies
  mitigations and describe when they should be applied
- Students will be able to write software that makes use of cybersecurity
  technologies and mitigations
- Students will be able to formulate privacy objectives for a software system
  and how they can be met.

## Learning Environment

Prior to each class, there will be an assigned reading. Students are expected to
complete this reading and come prepared with any questions they have about the
material in the reading. Class time will be divided into three sections:

- answering questions about the reading
- reviewing key topics from the reading
- doing exercises related to difficult to understand sections in the reading

At the end of most units, students will complete a project to demonstrate their
mastery of the material covered in the lectures.

Finally, two exams will access knowledge of the material covered in the
readings.

## Course Communications

- Use this website for the course schedule and assignments.

- Use Learning Suite to turn in assignments and see your grade.

- Use Discord for class discussion. I encourage you to post your questions on
  Discord so other students, the TAs, and the instructor can answer them for
  everyone. Here is a Discord invitation: TBD

- Use TA office hours to get help on course concepts and the projects. TAs are
  not expected to debug your program, but can talk to you about the concepts and
  whether your solution is going in the right direction.

- Use Instructor office hours as needed. Office hours with the instructor are
  generally underutilized! You are welcome to stop by for:

      - questions about concepts or assignments you aren't clear on
      - general advice about the CS degree
      - general advice about your career
      - just getting to know each other

## How to Be Successful in This Course

Come to class having finished the readings, prepared to ask any questions you
had about the material. For projects, start early. This will enable you to get
the help you need, and earn the extra credit available for staying ahead in
projects. Finally, for exams, come prepared, making sure you know the material
exactly not just generally. Most importantly, if you need help, please come and
talk to a TA or to me. We really are here to help you.

Computer Security and the Internet: Tools and Jewels from Malware to Bitcoin,
Second Edition. Paul C. van Oorschot. Springer, 2021.

If you are on campus or using the BYU VPN, you can also access a free PDF of the
book here: https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-83411-1

## Course Requirements

- Exams: There will be two exams covering material from the lectures and
  assigned readings. Together, these exams will each be worth 30% of the
  student’s final grade.

- Projects: There will be 8 projects. These projects will give students hands-on
  experience with the topics covered in class. Cumulatively, these projects will
  account for 70% of a student’s final grade. Projects are due before midnight
  on Saturday.

## Late Policy

There is no penalty for late work. _But wait, there is a catch._ Your job a
student is to:

- Stay on top of the class readings, coming to class, and learning.

- Do your best to turn work in on time. Otherwise, you're hurting your ability
  to learn, and learning is why you are here (in my class, and on earth).

- Turn in all work by the last day of classes for the semester.

- Talk to me if you are falling more than a week behind in class.

- Talk to me if you have official university accommodations that I can help you
  with.

- Especially talk to me if you have any physical or mental health issues, or
  major life events that will impact your ability to finish. I will work with
  you to see how you can be successful.
